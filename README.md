# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create an Excel dashboard for analyzing road accident data to identify trends and patterns.

## Methodology

The following steps were taken to create the dashboard:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Duplicate rows were removed.
   - Errors in the data were corrected.
   - Data was converted to a consistent format.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Excel pivot tables and charts were utilized for data analysis.
   - Identification of trends and patterns, such as common accident types, dangerous times of day, and accident-prone locations.

3. **Dashboard Creation:**
   - Excel charts and tables were used to create the dashboard.
   - The dashboard includes various visualizations to present data in different ways.

## Results

The dashboard provides insights into road accident data, including:

- The most common accident types are single-vehicle, followed by two-vehicle and three-vehicle accidents.
- The most dangerous time of day for accidents is between 4 pm and 7 pm.
- Accident-prone locations include urban areas and single-carriageways.
- The primary cause of accidents is driver error.

## Conclusion

The dashboard serves as a valuable tool for analyzing road accident data, enabling the identification of trends and patterns. The information can be utilized to develop strategies for reducing accidents and enhancing road safety.

For example, the dashboard includes a pie chart showing the distribution of accidents by severity, highlighting that the majority are slight accidents, followed by serious and fatal accidents. Additionally, a bar chart depicts the number of accidents by day of the week, revealing Saturday as the most dangerous day.

Overall, the image displays a well-designed and informative dashboard for analyzing road accident data.

## Next Steps

The dashboard can be further enhanced by:

- Adding filters for data by location, date range, and other criteria.
- Integrating additional data sources, such as weather and traffic data, for a comprehensive view of road safety.
